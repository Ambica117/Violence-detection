The Smart City CCTV Violence Detection project focuses on leveraging advanced 
computer vision techniques to automatically detect violent activities in video footage 
captured by surveillance systems. With the increasing deployment of CCTV cameras in 
urban environments, there is a growing need for automated solutions to enhance public 
safety by quickly identifying potential threats. This project uses motion-based feature 
extraction through optical flow and machine learning models to classify video segments as 
violent or non-violent, aiming to provide an efficient and scalable solution for real-time 
monitoring in smart city infrastructures.
